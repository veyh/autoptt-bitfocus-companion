[Release Archive](https://soupbawx.com/autoptt-bitfocus-companion/index.html)

## Install

Download a release, then open the Bitfocus Companion GUI and from the menu, select **Modules**. Then click the **Import module package** button and select the file you just downloaded. 

AutoPTT should now be visible in the modules list.

Next, select **Connections** from the menu and click on AutoPTT. Make sure the IPC address is set to `tcp://127.1.2.3:4000` (or whatever you have it set to in AutoPTT's **Settings/General** tab) and press **Save**.

Automatic updates to this plugin won't work at the moment because I haven't submitted it through the official channels. If you want to know of new releases, you can follow [AutoPTT's Twitter/X account](https://x.com/autoptt_com).
